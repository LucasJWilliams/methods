    <p> A simple tool for learning the names of Minor methods, 
        intended particularly for touch screens.  </p>
        <p>
        Select the over-work (shown in UPPER CASE), under-work (lower case), 
        and lead-end for the method shown.  
        Correct responses are highlighted in green, incorrect ones in red.  Answers are timed.
        Methods are random,
        favouring those that have had slower or incorrect responses previously.  The percentage score 
        reflects speed and accuracy.  It never 
        reaches 100%, but keeping it above 95% for an extended period is a reasonable challenge.  
        The pause button temporarily suspends timing.  Reloading the page erases the score and 
        starts again.</p>
